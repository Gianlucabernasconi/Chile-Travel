 
# Chile Travel 🌎✈️

Welcome to Chile Travel! This is a simple project I developed to improve my skills using Tailwind CSS. Chile Travel is a website that allows you to explore some of the most impressive and recommended locations in Chile.

## Features 📋

- **Responsive Design**: The site adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both mobile devices and desktops.
- **Dark Mode**: I implemented a toggle to switch between light and dark modes, enhancing accessibility and personalization for users.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: The navigation bar allows quick access to the Home, Featured Rentals, Recommended, FAQs, and About Us sections.
- **Interactive Cards**: I used cards with background images to highlight recommended locations and featured rentals.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styles and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the dark mode toggle and icon updates.
